### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cameron. I'm a student and stay-at-home dad hoping to launch a career in UX Design.
I'm originally from Oklahoma City but spent the last 10 years in Austin, TX. I started my career in the film industry, working in cinematography, set, and graphic design. After freelancing for a few years, I eventually took a position with the Austin Film Society as their Facility Manager. As FM, I oversaw a 28-acre film studio, a public access television station, and a 2-screen arthouse cinema. I also occupied a leadership position on the team that produces the Texas Film Awards, an event that annually kicks off the film portion of SXSW. In 2018, I was approached by a recruiter for the facilities management team at Facebook. I spent the next 3+ years overseeing the core MEP programs across all of Facebook's (now Meta) Central Texas locations (over a million sqft!).
During the pandemic, my wife and I had our daughter. That, combined with a family illness, brought us back home to OKC. The timing felt right for a career transition. I was grateful for the opportunities facility management afforded, but I felt I needed to get back to something more creative and challenging. I had been admiring UX/UI from afar for years. So, once we settled in OKC, I took the leap.
I'm nearing the end of the Google/Coursera UX Design Certification program. I've also been taking classes online through OSU. I'm excited to be starting a new chapter and making connections here in my home state. So, if anyone here is also interested in UX/UI, let's connect! I'd love to grab a coffee and chat!
